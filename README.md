##Big Presentation Xcode 5 Theme

A modified Xcode 5 theme based on Presentation. 

Useful for giving a lecture / talk in a big room, with poor-eyesighted people.

I haven't changed anything *but* font size, which is now __24.0__ (yeah, it was a large room!)

# Manual Install

1. Download this theme
2. in Terminal.app (or iTerm, DTerm, ...)

write:

    cp *.dvtcolortheme ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes/
